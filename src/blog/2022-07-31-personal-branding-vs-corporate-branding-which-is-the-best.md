Branding is important for a business or person to be recognized or trusted, it is what explains a business to a potential customer in simple terms.

An entrepreneur can choose to go for personal branding or business branding, but which is best for you and why?

We will be looking at some advantages and disadvantages of personal and business branding, but before we dive into that let's look at some brief explanation of personal branding and business branding.

##### What is Personal branding?

Personal branding as it sounds can be referred to as the act of positioning one's self, reputation, and value at high standards in a specific industry. An individual promotes his/her image through experience, achievements, and expertise in the industry.

##### What is Corporate branding?

Corporate branding also known as business branding is the building of a company's reputation and image in an Industry, in corporate brand attention is given to the company itself, what it has to offer and how well it can deliver. It requires lots of marketing and branding processes to be recognized.

##### Personal branding vs Corporate branding

Finally into this, as an individual who wants to venture into skill and later on brand that skill, should you go for personal branding or corporate branding?

##### 1. The process


it's advisable to build a personal brand which will surely make the process of building a corporate brand a piece of cake, in terms of trust people tend to patronize personal brands rather than corporate brands. For one to even run a corporate brand you must have a skill/service or product to offer, and that's where you heavily focus on the service/product and marketing.  

On the other hand, a personal brand tends to market itself at a certain height, as personal brands attract more referrals than a corporate brand will ever, the focus will be on your skill and how to keep yourself updated, so it's easy to stand stable as a fully built personal brand, unlike a business brand can still lose all even when it's fully built.

##### 3. Corporate branding is more stressful than personal


To run a corporate brand you need to go through exhausting processes, including legal, marketing, team, etc. A personal brand is just you and you alone, one social platform for yourself, you handle stuff once, a corporate brand needs every process built differently.

##### 4. Running a corporate brand is highly competitive


Let's take, for example, a web developer with lots of experience in the industry who decided to rebrand to corporate branding, then you have to rank over other web agencies around you to attract contracts consistently, no many your experience no one will still know that new brand till you push it through marketing and this must be done consistently or you run out of business because the competition is high. 

On the other hand, a web developer with lots of experience can attract contracts consistently without marketing, the experience and expertise in the industry will do the work.

##### 5. Personal branding is the key


Most all corporate brands were formed from personal branding which was later reformed, a writer can rebrand to a blog company, a web developer can rebrand to a web agency and all these will be done easily, personal branding is always advisable to every starting entrepreneur out there. A corporate brand that was reformed from an expert personal brand will do far better than a corporate brand that came that way in the industry.

In conclusion, you can choose to go for any, introverts tend to go for the corporate brand than a personal brand avoiding the attention and communications involved, and a corporate brand will always deliver faster than a personal brand.
