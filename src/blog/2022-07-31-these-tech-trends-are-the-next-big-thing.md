We all love to know what the future holds and also witnessing it, most of these tech hypes and trends are already coming to reality as investors and government are supporting tech startups, researchers, corporations in building the future of technology, when talking about the future we all know technology is and will always play a huge part in our lives now and forever, presently there are lots of tech trends promising lots of exciting and amazing things in the future, but which is really the next big thing. Let's look into that.

##### 1. Artificial intelligence 

Artificial intelligence which consist of machine learning, deep learning, natural language, digital humans and lots of other subcategories is really going to be the next big thing.

The future is possibly going to be hyper-automated and tasks will be carried out easier than ever before, all these are already becoming a reality as self driving cars, humanoid robots, etc. are coming to the marketplace slowly.

Even with all these hype and trends about artificial intelligence, we should all know we're still in the early days of it inventions, but the exciting and positive thing about artificial intelligence is that it will have lots of use cases, from health, engineering, business, agriculture, education and every other sectors, it will be part of our daily lives and likely to replace lots of occupation.

##### 2. Clean tech and Renewable Energy

Sustainable development is what big tech, corporations and the government are trying to achieve, the presence of climate change has surely been felt and if it continues earth will be inhabitable for it dwellers, the next big thing is to use tech to repair tech and the environment. More 190 countries have come together for this cause and working towards the goal to reach net zero by 2050 and the greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 45% by 2030.

##### 3. Blockchain Technology

The future of finance is going to be decentralized, and not just that but the internet entirely, we are presently and slowly transiting from web 2 to web 3 where the power is given to the users of the internet and no longer monopoly companies. The blockchain technology has powered several tech trends, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, inter-border transfers and so much more, the blockchain technologies has lots of use cases and will definitely achieve its full potential

##### 4. Robotics

Robotics has really played a huge role in manufacturing companies and tech company as a whole, in a short time it will be part of our daily lives, with the presence of artificial intelligence, robots will be given incredible capabilities to make decisions, carry out complex tasks and also learn from past experiences like humans.

##### 5. 3D Printing

In the nearest future we will make construction and manufacturing materials by 3d printing in a larger scale, 3d printing of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model.

##### 6. Virtual Reality

The future of socialization won't be bounded by smartphones, laptops, smartwatch etc. but we are going to be immerse into another world and get full experience of anything without being particularly there.

##### 7. Cyber Security

There are thousands of vulnerabilities in software, products, etc. and this is something that will continue to exist as more invention are made, to be on a safer side huge focus needs to be placed on cybersecurity, more technologies more vulnerabilities and that is why cybersecurity will be continue be a huge market.

There are lots of tech trends yet to impact much, but these are significantly going to be the next big thing, some special mentions are **Internet of Things, Genomics, Drones, Nano Technology, Big Data (Data Science)** and more.
