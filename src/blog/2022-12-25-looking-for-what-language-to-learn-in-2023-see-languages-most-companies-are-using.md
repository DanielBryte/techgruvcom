imageAlt: Programming language to learn in 2023
---
As we enter the final stretch of 2022, many individuals are starting to think about their goals for the coming year. For many, learning a new skill is high on the list of priorities, you might love to transition into tech or instead learn a new programming language, but with so many options out there, it can be tough to decide which language is the best choice for you.\
\
However, If you're considering learning a new programming language in 2023, you can narrow down your options by using some key criteria such as; learning a language that is in demand in the job market, with this, you can increase your chances of finding employment or advancing in your career, learning a language with high popularity and community support, with this, you'll have access to a wealth of resources and support as you learn, ease of learning and compatibility with other languages is also another criteria.\
\
\
Overall, the best programming language for you to learn will depend on your individual goals and needs, but to avoid being drowned in a pool of choices, I have drafted 10 programming languages you should consider learning in 2023 based on what most companies are hiring for:\
\
\
**1. Javascript (React, Angular, Node JS...)**\
\
Standing as the most popular programming language for building web applications, and used on the front-end as well as the back-end of web development, Javascript should be a language you should consider learning in 2023. The high demand and use of JS frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, Node, Express, and so on, make it easier for companies and programmers to build highly scalable products around Javascript stacks.\
\
**2. Python**\
\
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in a variety of fields, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, which makes it a great choice for beginners as well as experienced developers.\
\
Python is also widely used in the field of machine learning, with libraries such as sci-kit-learn and TensorFlow providing powerful tools for building and training machine learning models.\
\
Overall, Python is a highly demanded-programming language that is used in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and more. It is a great choice for those looking to build a career in programming, as it is a versatile language that can be applied to many different types of projects.\
\
**3. Java**\
\
Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in the development of enterprise-level applications and Android apps. It is known for its portability, as Java code can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.\
\
Java is a popular choice for building enterprise-level applications because of its scalability, reliability, and security, in addition to its use in enterprise-level development, Java is also widely used in the development of Android apps. The Android operating system is based on the Java programming language, and developers can use Java to build native Android apps that can be distributed through the Google Play Store.\
\
Overall, Java is a highly demanded-programming language that is used in a wide range of industries and applications. You can consider learning Java in 2023 to become an Android developer before the year ends.\
\
**4. SQL**\
\
SQL is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is used to perform tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting databases and tables; inserting, updating, and deleting data; and creating, modifying, and executing queries to retrieve data from databases.\
\
SQL is a standard language used by many different RDBMS, including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle. This means that SQL skills are highly portable and in demand by companies that use RDBMS to store and manage their data.\
\
The demand for SQL skills has consistently ranked high among programming languages. According to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, SQL was the third most popular language among developers, with over 50% of respondents indicating that they had used it in the past year.\
\
It is expected that this trend will continue in 2023 and beyond, as data management and analysis continue to be important for businesses in a wide range of industries. SQL skills are particularly in demand for positions such as data analysts, data scientists, and database administrators.\
\
**5. C#**\
\
In the past few years, C# has consistently ranked as one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is expected to continue to be in high demand in the coming years. One of the main reasons for this is the wide range of applications that C# is used for. It is commonly used to develop Windows desktop applications, mobile apps, games, and web applications.\
\
In addition to its versatility and the rich ecosystem of tools and libraries available to developers, C# is also known for its strong security features and its support for modern programming paradigms such as asynchronous programming and LINQ (Language Integrated Query), it should be a language you should consider in 2023.
