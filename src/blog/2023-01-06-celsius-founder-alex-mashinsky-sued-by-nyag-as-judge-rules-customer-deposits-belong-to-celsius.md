The New York Attorney General (NYAG) has sued Celsius founder, Alex Mashinsky, claiming that customer deposits belong to Celsius and not to him. According to the ruling of the judge, Mashinsky allegedly took deposits from customers who wanted to buy cryptocurrency on the Celsius platform and used it for personal and corporate purchases. The court also determined that Mashinsky was not entitled to any of these funds because they belong solely to his competitor, Celsius. In its ruling, the court also found that Mashinsky had illegitimately used customer deposits for his own personal gain and had acted in a manner that was “unlawful and deceptive”.

The founder of the cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platform Celsius, Alex Mashinsky, was in the headlines recently when the New York Attorney General (NYAG) accused him of mismanaging customer deposits. The NYAG was supported by a judge’s ruling which stated that customer deposits belong to Celsius. This is a significant milestone for cryptocurrencies and financial technology as it redefines how companies can lawfully keep customer funds safe. The judgement has raised issues regarding the trustworthiness of technology companies like Celsius in securely handling customer deposits. The implications of this judgement could have far-reaching consequences for the digital finance industry in terms of regulation enforcement and customer protection. According to the court ruling, Mashinsky would have to hand over customer funds totalling $9.5 million. This lawsuit may have a significant impact on how the blockchain-based lending solution company operates in the future.

Celsius is a digital currency platform which provides users with secure storage of their assets, as well as options to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies on either fixed or variable rates. However, with this ruling from the NYAG, it is becoming increasingly clear what kind of responsibility cryptocurrency platforms have over the assets that their customers entrust them with.

On June 10th, the New York Attorney General (NYAG) sued Celsius Holdings Inc. founder and its President Alex Mashinsky over alleged consumer fraud. The NYAG argued in court that customer deposits made to Celsius should be given back to customers as deposits belong to them and not to the Celsius founders. The judge agreed with this argument, affirming that customer deposits are owned by customers and not by Mashinsky nor his company.

The lawsuit comes in response to allegations that Mashinsky misled customers about how their money was being used, as well as how secure the coins were and were protected from hacks. This marks a major setback for Celsius, which has grown rapidly since its launch in 2018, offering interest-bearing digital asset accounts and borrowing services for cryptocurrency traders. In addition to this, the judge also ruling prohibits further sales of unreleased coins or assets related to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

Alex Mashinsky, the founder of cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network, is taking heat from New York’s top financial enforcer for misappropriation of customer funds. On October 16th 2020, a Manhattan judge ruled that the Billionaire entrepreneur and his company must return $3 million frozen in customer accounts, while at the same time granting a partial victory to customers who are seeking damages in excess of $90 Million. According to the suit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, Mashinsky and Celsius had been using customer deposits as collateral on loans to other projects and leveraging investments. The lawsuit further alleges that customers' funds were at risk of being lost depending on those projects’ performance, without customers being fully informed. The court granted an immediate payment of the frozen funds plus 8% in interest back to customers who are part of this lawsuit. The litigation will continue as more details about misuse and misappropriation remain to be established by both sides.

The dispute between Celsius and the NYAG dates back to February 2021 when Mashinsky claimed that customer deposits were part of Lentulus' parent company, Dash Holdings. However, Judge Nathania Seib ruled that Dash Holdings was not liable for the funds held in Celsius’ accounts.

This ruling could have major ramifications for companies who hold user funds on behalf of their customers. It also highlights the importance of investors taking steps to ensure their deposits are secure, especially when dealing with cryptocurrency investment firms like Celsius which are unregulated entities.

As a result of this lawsuit, customers can now be sure that their funds are protected by Celsius when they deposit them with the platform. The findings of this case will also help to set an example for other cryptocurrency companies and ensure that such cases do not recur in future.

The case sheds light on how digital currencies can come under more scrutiny from governments and regulators in order to ensure that customers’ deposits remain safe and secure. It is also an example of how companies working with crypto assets must adhere to financial regulations and consumer protection in their operations even if their activities fall outside of traditional finance protocols.

The ruling has caused a major uproar amongst investors in cryptocurrency as they are uncertain about their future in the market. The case against Mashinsky may have significant implications for cryptocurrency markets if customers cannot trust their exchanges and other platforms handling customer deposits. The NYAG is seeking recompense for damages both on behalf of themselves and those affected by this alleged misuse of customer funds.
