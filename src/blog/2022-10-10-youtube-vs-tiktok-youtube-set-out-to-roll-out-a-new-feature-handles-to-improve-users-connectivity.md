In an email sent to all YouTube creators, the team announced that the platform will be rolling out a new feature called "Handle" which will provide users with new ways to connect and find each other on YouTube, unlike YouTube channel names, handles will be unique and tied to just one channel making it easier for it users to connect with the right creator and other users on YouTube.

Your handle with be displayed on several surfaces within YouTube, including your home page, search results, short feeds, a community post, and comment sections, this new feature will aid creators in promoting their channels and well as improving the app experience for its users.

YouTube will gradually roll out the handles over the coming weeks and all users will be notified through email or the YouTube studio when they’re able to choose a handle for all channels. However, for most YouTube creators who already have a personalized URL for their channel, the team has reserved the URLs for their handle, but it can still be changed to a different handle from the one they've reserved.

Starting on November 14, 2022, if you haven’t yet selected a handle for your channel, YouTube will automatically assign you a handle, which you can change in YouTube Studio if you'd like, to learn more about this new feature you can check more info on YouTube official release note **[here](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-handles-a-new-way-to-identify-your-youtube-channel/)**
