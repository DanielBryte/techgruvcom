Devtranet is building an official network for developers to connect, build, and discover opportunities, the name was coined from the words ”developers, techies, network, community and planet”.

TechGruv reached out to Ibrahim Salami, the co-founder and CEO of Devtranet on talks about the startup journey, the problem they are trying to solve and their future plans.

##### TechGruv: What is your technical background like?

**Ibrahim :** I started gaining interest in tech while I was still in primary school, from building with  Legos, I then  scavenged for electronics parts to build a robot out of it. I shifted interest to software when he was in SS1 due to the difficulty in finding electrical components.

##### What problems will you be solving with Devtranet?

There are lots of problems relating to developers and companies, and we focus on not just companies nor developers alone but on both parties, from networking, job opportunities, recruitment for developers and companies etc., Devtranet will be the answer.

##### What motivated and inspired you to build Devtranet?

Well, after successfully running Codetivate which is now part of Devtranet, and aided a fundraise of over half a million dollars, I discovered the intense need for developer relations and Devtranet came into existence. As of 2020, tech contributes 15.5% to the world's GDP of $84.71 trillion and we are building a platform for those who are building the internet, Developer's relationships contribute largely to a company's success and decision making.

##### How do you see the market you're targeting?

We have achieved a lot within 3 months, the market doesn't seem too competitive, we have crossed huge milestones, from generating revenue of $10,000 from 3 sales, to closing lots of partnerships with big tech companies and a lot more. They are several competitors but we don't do exactly the same thing, our vision and focus is more precise.

##### Is Devtranet raising anytime soon?

Investors have been reaching out to us, but we don't want to raise presently. Probably, we will consider raising funds next year but not now.

##### What scares you the most in this start-up journey or what will you find challenging in the future?

Actually, the recruiting processes, getting the right team and people to actualize the vision with us.

##### What do you feel or plan about the future of Devtranet?

By December or January we will be releasing our private Beta.

##### That's great news. What advice will you give to upcoming founders/first-time founders?

They should try to validate their idea as much as possible, making sure you're solving a problem and also being realistic.
