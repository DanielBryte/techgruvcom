The Billion Dollar Code is a must-watch movie for every entrepreneur, unlike the most clichéd start-up stories of rags to riches, the underdog that disrupted the entire industry, or two nerds that oddly turned a hobby into a unicorn – it does the opposite and profoundly so. It is a painful story that resonates with stories of entrepreneurs who had the best idea, passion, and an unmatched zest to change the world but somehow found themselves in the dustbin of history never to be heard or spoken of.

90% of start-ups fail and only 10% succeed. What are the factors that contribute to a business failing right off the bat? Lack of cash flow, bad marketing, lousy partnership, the wrong market, lack of research, and lack of brand awareness; everything stems from what problems you are solving and what solutions you are providing. Do you have a precise and concise plan on how you are going to navigate the intricacies and demands of the business world? Adequate self-awareness although understated plays a very pivotal role in making your business a success. A fair assessment of your strengths is equally as important as self-belief if not more.

With that being said, here are the core recipes all successful start-ups have in common: 

##### 1. A clear vision

All successful startups started by Identifying a specific problem and working hard to find an effective solution to that problem. Every successful startup sets a clear vision and follows it sternly till they succeed. The vision must sufficiently provide what you want to achieve and well-defined a mission statement that guides the founders, team, and employees' actions, and decisions.

##### 2. A Strong passionate team

Every successful startup started with a team of skilled and dedicated individuals who share the same vision and are committed to success, a startup is more than just an idea, getting that idea into reality is what makes it a startup. Choosing and setting up the right team is one of the most crucial steps in taking your startup to success.

##### 3. Solid business model

Another element of a successful startup is having a strong business model, a business model entails information about your target market, competition, finances, operations, and future projections to attract the best investors and accelerators to support your startup.

You need to prove your startup has the capability of generating profitable revenue in time to come, a well-defined revenue stream constitutes a very solid business model. A business model is very crucial to your startup, it's essentially the map that will guide you to getting the capital, without capital, the business will be non-existent or hard to grow and maintain.

##### 4. Pivoting and iterations

The journey of building a successful startup involves continual improvement, measurement, and iterations to get the perfect product for the target market while maintaining stability in a dynamic business world. The founders and team have to know when to iterate plans or pivot to a suitable business plan, always measure their progress and adjust strategies where necessary.

##### 5. Strategic Partnership

Partnerships are either the break or make of any start-up. A strategic and successful partnership can take your startup to a level it might take long years to reach. Partner with individuals/companies who fits the mission and vision of your start-up and they are equally yoked on making the start-up a huge success.

To build a successful partnership for your startup, you need to first start with building solid relationships with valuable companies, investors, and your startup industry/niche experts. A successful start-up must have a network of strategic partnerships and collaborations that can help it reach new customers, access new markets, and leverage complementary resources.

##### 6. A customer-focused approach

Every successful start-up employed a customer-focused approach, putting the needs and desires of its target market at the forefront of all its decisions and actions. Always seeking new and better ways to serve its customers and achieve its goals, having a unique value proposition will take your startup ahead of the competitions.

##### 7. Great financial management

Effective budgeting cost control and forecasting are great financial management practices. A business is a machine of interdependent systems, failure in one department inevitably affects the entire business. Lack of discipline in managing finances attracts very damaging consequences.

##### 8. Think big (be the goal-getter)

Some start-ups prefer remaining small while others look for ways and means to reach new markets. The choice invariably lies in the vision.
Starting a business is hard but a very rewarding experience. Go for it. Ignore the noise, be the goal-getter, and don't just plan but be fast in execution.
